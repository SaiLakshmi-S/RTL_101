# Difference between Latches and Flip-Flops

# Latches:

- Latches are level triggered (O/P depends on level of I/P signal rather than Transition of signal). 
- Operation depends on the Enable Signal. Clock Signal is not required.
- It is Faster and Simpler.
- Consumes less power.
- It is used in Asynchronous circuits.

# Flip-Flops:

- Flip-Flops are edge triggered (O/P changes when there is a Transition in I/P signal).
- Operation depends on Clock Signal.
- It is Slower and Complex.
- Consumes more power.
- It is used in Synchronous circuits.
